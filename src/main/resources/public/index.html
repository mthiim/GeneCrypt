					<b>Try out a live proof-of-concept of my Confidential Computing Challenge Entry 'GeneCrypt',
						where you can encrypt and upload the code for a gene, under a key you generate and control here in your browser! You can then decide if you wish to grant an Asylo enclave access to
						the key so that it can analyze the gene and return some limited information about it.<sup>*</sup></b>
				</p>

				<p>In this PoC, the browser takes the role of the agent of the end-user. Using Web Crypto API, the
				code on this page generates and stores the encryption key that protects the genome when stored "at rest" in a
				Gene Bank. This allows the end-user to have full control of what happens to their genomic data. In a real-life implementation, the user agent would likely
					be an app running on a mobile device, probably using hardware-secured key stores.
					The main point of the GeneCrypt concept is that the 
					agent can remotely attest the Asylo enclave and ask the user if it should be allowed to run some analysis and return the result. This is the only way the genome can be accessed. The mechanism
					doesn't rely on the security of the gene bank, and the gene bank doesn't learn the result of the analysis, 
					since this is encrypted as well, under a key specified when launching the enclave (and quoted during attestation).
					In this example, the public key is that of the end-user (generated here in the browser). It could also be the
					public key of a doctor or other person trusted by the end-user to receive the analysis result.</p>
				<p>
					All source code (including enclave code) available on <a href="https://github.com/mthiim/GeneCrypt">GitHub</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tested as working on the latest Chrome, Safari and Mozilla Firefox browsers. Positively doesn't work on Microsoft Edge, due to a <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/11348074/">bug</a> in the GCM-AES implementation.

						<p>In this first step, we will initialize the end-user
							agent/device which will be used to guard and control the
							cryptographic keys for the genome. We will start by generating
							(using the Web Crypto API) an asymmetric key pair (in this
							case, RSA 2048 bits). The private key is only stored on the
							client-side, i.e. in the browser. The public key is registered
							with the gene bank.
							This simulates a real-life scenario where the end-user installs an app on their mobile device, which then generates the key pair
							to control their genetic data, and registers an account with the gene bank. When submitting biological samples to the
							gene bank, the data would be encrypted by the end-user's public key. We will look closer into this in the next
							step.</p>

						<p>As the second step, we will upload a genome to be stored on the backend, in
							an imaginary gene bank. In real
							life, the user would submit a biological sample for sequencing.
							The gene bank would generate a unique, symmetric encryption key
							(AES-256) and encrypt this specific genome with that. The
							symmetric key would itself be encrypted with the end-user public
							key we generated and registered in the previous step. The gene
							bank would only store the encrypted genome and the encrypted,
							symmetric genome encryption key. In this PoC, we will simulate
							this by encrypting the genetic data in the browser, under a
							random symmetric key, and upload both the encrypted genetic data
							as well as the encrypted, symmetric genome encryption key, encrypted under the
							public key we generated in the previous step.
							To
							make things more interesting, you can now select the genetic data
							to encrypt and upload. We imagine this is a gene that has two variants, one
							associated with a high risk of some disease, and one with normal risk. 
							The normal risk variant has 'A' as its fourth letter in the genetic code, whereas all other
							letters in this position are associated with higher risk of disease.
							This variance pattern (a single letter/nucleotide difference) is known as a Single Nucleotide
							Polymorphism and is a common type of genetic variance associated with disease. Of course, enclaves can be developed for the detection of more
							complicate genetic variants for other diseases.
							
							Using the radio buttons below, you can select the
							variant of the gene to encrypt and upload (or hand edit it here).

						<p>As the third step, we will simulate the launching of a request for allowing
							a specific enclave to decrypt and analyze the user's genome. The enclave is able to screen
							for the genetic variant discussed in the previous step and returns just an encrypted true/false value regarding
							the prescence of the genetic variance.
							If you press the "Launch enclave" button below, the Asylo-enclave is
							launched. It is given as a parameter a nonce and 
							the public key it should use for encrypting the genome (in this PoC, this is the public key
							for the end-user but in real-life could be the key of e.g. the patient's doctor).
							As part of its initialization, the enclave will generate an ephemeral key pair (session key pair)
							for secure communication with the user agent (this page). The enclave will produce a quote (suitable for remote attestation)
							containing its launch parameters as well as the public key of the key pair.
							Since Asylo doesn't yet implement remote attestation, in this PoC, it is simulated by simply signing 
							the data to be quoted with a
							software signing key in the backend (rather than an "endorsement key" in hardware), where the public key is built into this page. 
							The Asylo enclave is kept running and in the next step you can decide whether to grant it access to decrypt the genome and run the analysis!
